## Hello There!

My name is Hudson Smith and I am a software developer.

I like Linux, Python and Bash.


### Being awesome in Bash:

```bash
function be_awesome ()
{
	echo "I am awesome."
}

while :; do
	be_awesome
done
```

### Being awesome in Python:
```python
def be_awesome() -> None:
	print("I am awesome.")

while True:
	be_awesome()
```
