## StackEdit Rocks!

Often times I want to write a README file or a blog post in markdown.

Problem is, as a student, I do not have access to dev tools 100% of the time.

I would write an email to myself that contained the markdown to edit later, but without visual feedback, I would end up writing in a flawed/incorrect manner.

One day I searched for the term, "Online Markdown Editor," and StackEdit appeared at the top of the list.

After seeing that it was open-source, I decided to give it a try.

One word...

Amazing

It has all the features of a modern desktop markdown editor in a browser.

I'm amazed by the sheer amount of features packed into this product.

Google Drive sync, web publishing, exporting, printing, and even a version control system!
